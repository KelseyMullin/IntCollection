# IntCollection
This work sample is an assignment I completed for my Data Structures class this semester.  This project is the sixth version of IntCollection.  Each version used a different data structure to store a collection of positive, non-repeated integers.  Previous versions used an arrray of ints, an array of booleans, and linked lists.  This version of IntCollection stores the ints in a binary search tree.  Our instructions for these assignments were to keep the public method names and documentation the same for each version of the class so that client code would not have to change.  The IntCollectionClient that I have included along with my project was given to us for testing our classes, although I have made a few changes to it in order to check all methods.
